The following are ideas of my own and suggestions from others for
improvement of Wanda:

- Fix: Closing not from tasklist doesn't work
- Fix: If note gets activated, check that cursor is activated in this note too
- Fix: SysBar does not show title of last (opened?) note?
- Fix: When activating the horizontal scrollbar, last word in note vanishes

- "Arrange" option that automatically arranges notes on the screen in some way
- Keep notes in (a subset?) of HTML
- Allow "links" in notes, that show another note when selected
- If notesfile does not exist, but backuped notesfile exists, make backup to
  notesfile
- "Rainbow-notes" (randomly change bg-color every time they get activated): 
  will always again catch attention
- Allow macros in notes (Date, time, etc.)
- Allow to give notes no or only 1 pxl border with configurable color
- Allow user-change of note title
- "New note" entry in tasklist to make new note from there
- Change bg-color of note when note gets focus
- Every note gets "next" and "previous" button that "moves to" the next or
  previous note in the list
- When notelist active (or something) move all non-hidden notes in front of
  other windows
- Autosize for notes, so they automatically adjust their size to the longest
  text/lines
- Allow "remote control" of Wanda, either via named pipes or TCP/IP or both
- A settings window/notebook so you don't have to use cmdline args
- Do the printing using the system's printer objects
- Allow to have notes automatically shown at certain events/certain time
- Allow sorting of notes in the notelist window
- Allow to shrink note windows so only the titlebar is shown
- Have titlebar of note to be deleted flash
- WPS integration so you e.g. have a note template with which you can
  create new notes
- Allow for notes to always float on top of other windows
- Allow bitmap as note background
- Allow to "stick" notes to other windows (WPS folders e.g.)
- Drag a file over a note -> load file's contents into the note
- Drag a file to the notelist window -> create a new note with file's cont.
- Save notes as "outgoing mail" in appropriate dir for PostRoad mailer
- Allow every note to have its own icon that is display in the notelist
- For selected: change fg-color, change bg-color, change font
- Delay opening windows until note gets activate/shown -> faster start of
  program
- Allow crypting notes (with Blowfish) and/or passwords
