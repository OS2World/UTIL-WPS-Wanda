OFFICIAL WANDA HYMN
[To be sung after Black Sabbath's "Paranoid"]


Wrote a program "Wanda" but
I didn't write it just for me

People think I'm insane because
I give it away for free

All day long I think of things
that I can add to satisfy

Lots of stuff is still to do
but don't blame me, believe, I try


CHORUS:
Can you help me find and fix the bugs?
Oh yeah


Write some notes and save them down
and then print out another one

Change the colors, fonts and shapes
It's useful and it's lots of fun

Got a word you're looking for?
Have Wanda search it up for you

Or just replace it, if you like
Oh, there's so much more you can do!

And so as you hear this words
Telling you now of Wanda's state

Just load it down and check it out
It's really cool, don't hesitate!
